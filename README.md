# Brunoracle
The Brunoracle is an untrusted, single oracle model for smart contract evaluation. Its defining characteristics are the intention that smart contract code and logic are obfuscated to the contractorsâ€™ best abilities and that the oracle is protected against malicious contracts with a custom sandbox that is less expensive than a virtual machine, provides fine grained control, and maintains the same level of security as a virtual machine.
